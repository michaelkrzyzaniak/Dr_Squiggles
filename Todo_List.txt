Knitting Notes:
Stopper between pins 32 and 33
Colored yarn on inside of needle
40 rows 24 cols (+2?)
Eyes in row 21, 6 wide, pins 13 to 18
chain 1 between each crochet in bind-off row

todo: 

1) Fix 5v supply
	make shunt to measure current
	check max current of regulator and components
	put correct capacitors on both regulators.
	work out how to power bela from headers

2) Fix laser-cut skeleton
	Eye hole too small
	eye hole could stick forward further
	notches in eye hole to receive diffuser plate
	large tentacles smaller, small ones bigger
	make yarn grabber points bigger
	make enough space for internal components (pi, bealge?)
	fix issues with wood thickness
	mounting points for solenoids and whatever they strike

3) Firmware
	fix priority competition between eye and solenoid -- move midi read to solenoid thread?
	control striking strength
	optimize eye code and library, check i2c speed with logic analyzer
	
4) Main
	include tap strength in rhythm generation
	make new rhythm generation algorithms, e.g. 2-beat delay
	check if it will run on bela or raspi, and port code.
	Add methods to Microphone.c like turn beat bell on / off.

5) Strikers
	find metal scraps for beat bell, other materials for other solenoids?
